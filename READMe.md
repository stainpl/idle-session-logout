## Why use this

* Minimal and focused — does one thing well.
* Tiny footprint, zero runtime dependencies.
* Easy to plug into any frontend (plain JS, React, Vue, etc.).

---

## Install

Single-line install command with quick-copy affordance (emoji shown as lightweight visual affordance):


```bash
# install from npm
npm install idle-session-logout
```




---

## Usage

```js
import IdleSessionLogout from 'idle-session-logout';

const idle = new IdleSessionLogout({
  timeout: 30 * 60 * 1000, // 30 minutes in ms
  onTimeout: () => {
    alert('You were idle for 30 minutes.');
    window.location.href = '/login';
  }
});

idle.start();
```

This example uses the default 30‑minute timeout. See helpers below for nicer time helpers.

## Helpful helpers

If you prefer minutes for readability, include a tiny helper:

```js
const minutes = (m) => m * 60 * 1000;

// 30 minutes (explicit)
const idle = new IdleSessionLogout({
  timeout: minutes(30),
  onTimeout: () => { /* ... */ }
});

// 1 minute (for quick tests)
const testIdle = new IdleSessionLogout({
  timeout: minutes(1),
  onTimeout: () => { /* ... */ }
});
```

## API

### new IdleSessionLogout(options)

`options` (object):

* `timeout` **(required)** — Number. milliseconds until timeout.
* `onTimeout` **(required)** — Function called when timeout occurs.
* `events` — Optional array of DOM events to listen for (defaults: `['mousemove','keydown','mousedown','touchstart']`).
* `warningBefore` — Optional number (ms) to fire a warning callback before the final timeout.
* `onWarning` — Optional function called when the warning is triggered.

### Instance methods

* `start()` — Start listening for activity and begin the timer.
* `stop()` — Stop listening and clear timers.
* `reset()` — Reset the inactivity timer (useful if you manually detect activity).

## Recommended practices & tips

* **Default:** 30 minutes (1\_800\_000 ms).
* **Units:** always pass `timeout` in milliseconds.
* **Reasonable ranges:**

  * security-sensitive apps: `5–30 minutes`.
  * less-sensitive apps: longer timeouts as appropriate.
* **Testing:** set `timeout` to `minutes(1)` or `60000` during local development to validate flows quickly.
* **Warning UX:** if you display a “You’ll be logged out soon” modal, trigger it before the timeout (e.g., `warningBefore = 60_000` for a 1-minute warning) and allow the user to extend the session.
* **Resetting:** make sure the library resets the inactivity timer on the activity events you care about (mouse, keyboard, touch). If you customize event handling, ensure you still call `reset()`.
